        <p>If you are reading this, chances are you or someone you love has been abused or neglected in a nursing home or assisted living facility. Elder abuse and neglect cases constitute <em>100<small>%</small></em> of my practice focus. By 2016, after a decade in general civil law, representing people who had suffered injury or death in nursing homes and assisted living facilities felt like a <em>calling.</em> I have become experienced at identifying and litigating these special cases, working intimately with individuals and families to <em>protect our elders.</em> For me, law is an art. Each case is like a block of rough marble. Together we look at it from all possible angles and carve out its innate beauty: a true story that speaks to the heart and makes sense in relation to the laws of our society. And <em>that</em> is persuasive. Based on our recommendations, <em>you</em> will be the decision-maker as your case moves forward. I personally respond to all inquiries within one business day. Letâ€™s talk.
